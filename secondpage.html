      <p>Some of the things I like to do on my freetime which comes very rarely is going on hikes, playing tennis, hanging out with my friends,reading, painting, and drawing. Even though I'm not the best at neither of those they've always helped me when I was stressed or frustrated about things. Hanging out with friends has always been my favorite thing to do, going shopping with them, doing stupid stuff in the backyard, and just talking with them. Even though I have a lot of friends I like spending my time with one of them the most. We both instantly connected when we first met and we've been strong ever since. Though she is 2 years older then me, she still acts like shes 10. Which I love about her. </p>

At school, I've always been a good student, at everything and to eveyone. I was the type of girl who sat done on the swings or at a bench and read. I wouldn't socialize with a lot of people. I would be fasinated by art class. School subjects have came easy to me, except for Language Arts. Math and Science were always my favorite. Ever since I learned my multiplication table Math was the one for me. and in Science learning about the human body and biology had me hooked on. I love learning about all the human anatomy.
