<p>
I was born on August 8, 2005. My family and I moved to America from Nepal on April 29, 2008. I have 2 older siblings which makes me the youngest. In my family there are 5 members total. my mom, dad, brother, sister, and me. My siblings have been there for me through the majority of my life. From my first surgery when I was 3 to my first day of high school. Even though sometimes I wish I was an only child I'm grateful to have them.
</p>

<p> I've always been very close with both my mom and dad's side of the family. I love both of the sides equally but I love my mom's side more. My uncles and aunts have always helped me with anything I needed. They have always been my second biggest supporters after my parents. My cousins and I have always been the closest people out of my whole family and there is nothing I wouldn't do for them. Especially after all they have done for me.</p>
