<p>After high school, I want to go to a university that's going to help me pursue my dream of going into the medical field and becoming a pediatrician. Ever since I was little, I always dreamed of become some sort of a doctor. Whether it was a pathologist or a coroner. My parents have always wanted to see their little girl become someone who others could always look up to for their needs and worries.</p>

<p> Along with going to collage, it has always been a dream of mine to travel the world with 1 or 2 very close people in my life. But traveling the world comes after I'm settled down, debt free, and have a well paying job.</p>
